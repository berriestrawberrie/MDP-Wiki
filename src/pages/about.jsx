            My name is Brooke I'm 34 years old and originally from the USA, but
            I've recently moved to Sweden with my husband. With this new change
            I've decided to pursue software development as a new career path.
            I've also always been interested in virtual pet sites and wanted to
            create my own so now I'm taking the plunge. It is a lot of work for
            to do on my own but I enjoy all the hours I put into the game. Not
            only do I learn new things, but I have a wonderful place to express
            myself and hopefully I'll make something that other people can enjoy
            as well. This is not a project I've taken up for profit, and I will
            not be seeking outside funding at this time. This means that it will
            be a long journey but hopefully a fruitful one if I do move this to
            a more professional setting I may seek for paid assistance, but I'm
            definitely not there yet. I've created this space to help me
            organize my thoughts and develop different ideas. Everything on this
            site is under development and subject to change before the game is
            actually released.

            While this game can be played by kids it is meant for teenagers and
            older there will not be adult content in the game, but some themes
            may be more mature than something like My Little Pony. That being
            said I still would like this to be a safe space away from everyday
            debates we have in everyday life. My dream is that it's a space
            where people can express themselves and respect others of all
            backgrounds.
