            My dream pony will be a browser based virtual pet site. You will be
            able to breed pony like pet creatures, train them, collect items,
            restock npc shops for currency, farming, cooking, creating custom
            items decorations for all your ponies. This game is currently in
            development and is not expected to be available to the public for
            some time. As I am the sole developer, artist, and marketing team
            ðŸ˜Š. As this is a passion project I am steadily working to develop it
            and improve the coding, art and features.

              This game is all about the ponies. They are the main pet
              characters and come in all shapes and sizes. The current pony
              types are listed below, however there will be more pony types to
              come in the future some ideas in the works currently are pony
              types that you can only get through breeding and seasonally.
